    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vegan broth is slightly thick with rich color and full flavor. The broth can be frozen in 1- or 1 1/2-cup blocks for later use. This recipe also leaves you with a bowl full of deliciously cooked vegetables. I love to snack on them!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds sweet onions, peeled and cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 pound tomatoes, cored and quartered</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ pound turnips, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>6 whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 gallon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place onions, tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and turnips in a large roasting pan; drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until vegetables are tender and onions are caramelized, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Transfer roasted vegetables into a large stockpot. Add celery, parsley, garlic, peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaf. Pour in water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by half, 20 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain broth into a large bowl, reserving vegetables for another use.</li>
    </ol>
